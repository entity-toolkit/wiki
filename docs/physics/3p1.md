In order to host both GR and non-GR equations in a single framework while still retaining the maximum level of generality, we employ the 3+1 formulation of Maxwell's equations (see, e.g., [Gourgoulhon, 2012](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-24525-1)).

In the most general 3+1 formulation the metric in arbitrary coordinate system can be represented in the following form:

$$
g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
-\alpha^2+\beta^2 & \beta_j\\
\beta_i & h_{ij}\\
\end{bmatrix},
$$

where $\alpha$ is the metric _lapse function_, and $\beta_i$ is the metric _shift vector_. We will also denote $h \equiv \mathrm{det}{(h_{ij})}$ (notice, that $g\equiv \mathrm{det}{(g_{\mu\nu})} = -\alpha^2 h$)

In our code we only work with contravariant vectors (spatial components), $A^i$. Covariant counterparts are stored only for the auxiliary fields in GR, or otherwise may be obtained using the $h_{ij}$ spatial metric: $A_i = h_{ij} A^j$.

!!! example "Flat orthogonal metric"
    
    In flat spacetime with orthogonal coordinate system (e.g., cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc) we have $\alpha = 1$, $\beta_i = 0$, and $h_{ij} = \mathrm{diag}\left[h_1, h_2, h_3\right]$, also $h = h_1 h_2 h_3$. Covariant vector component can be trivially obtained: $A_i = h_i A^i$ (summation not implied here).

In this system, we can now express the curl of an arbitrary vector:

$$
(\nabla\times A)^i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j A_k,
$$

where $A_i = h_{ij} A^j$, and $\varepsilon^{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.

## Maxwell's equations

In 3+1 formulation there are two "physical" fields (the ones measured by fiducial observers, FIDOs), $B^i$, and $D^i$. Evolution equations on these two fields can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial D^i}{c\partial t} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j H_k - \frac{4\pi}{c} J^i, \\
\frac{\partial B^i}{c\partial t} &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j E_k,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $H_i$, and $E_i$ are the covariant auxiliary fields, defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H_i &= \alpha h_{ij} B^j - \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon_{ijk}\beta^j D^k, \\
E_i &= \alpha h_{ij} D^j + \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon_{ijk}\beta^j B^k.
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! example "Flat orthogonal metric"

    In flat space-time with diagonal $h_{ij}$, $D_i = E_i = h_i E^i$, and $B_i = H_i = h_i B^i$ (again, no summation implied here). Maxwell's equations (for the $i = 1$ component) expand to the following (having $h = h_1 h_2 h_3$):

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial E^i}{c\partial t} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \left[\partial_j (B_k) - \partial_k (B_j)\right] - \frac{4\pi}{c} J^i, \\
    \frac{\partial B^i}{c\partial t} &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \left[\partial_j (E_k) - \partial_k (E_j)\right],
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    where $B_i = h_i B^i$, $E_i = h_i E^i$ (no summation implied, $i\ne j\ne k$, and $ijk$ is an even permutation of $123$, i.e., $\varepsilon^{ijk}=+1$).

!!! example "Conversion to orthonormal basis (flat orthogonal metric)"

    Notice that in general the basis where this metric and field components are defined is not orthonormal. In general, one might need to convert the contravariant vector components, $A^i$, to orthonormal basis: $A^{\hat{i}}$. In case of flat orthogonal metric this can be written as (no summation implied): $A^{\hat{i}} = \sqrt{h_{i}} A^i$.

<!-- ### Axisymmetric

In 2D spherical coordinate system (axisymmetric, $\partial_\phi = 0$) discretized version of Maxwell's equation on $E^1$ ("radial") is singular at the polar axis: $h^{(i+1/2,~0)} = h^{(i+1/2,~n_2-1)} = 0$. -->

## Equations of motion for particles

The equation of motion for relativistic particles in such a 3+1 formulation have the following form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d x^i}{cd t} &= \alpha \frac{1}{\gamma}h^{ij} u_j - \beta^i,\\
\frac{d u_i}{cd t} &=
\underbrace{
  -\gamma \partial_i \alpha + u_j\partial_i \beta^j - \alpha\frac{1}{2\gamma} u_j u_k\partial_i h^{jk}
}_{\text{``curvature'' force}} +
\underbrace{
  \frac{q}{m c^2}\alpha\left(h_{ij}D^j + \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}\gamma}\varepsilon_{ijk}h^{jl} u_l B^k\right)
}_{\text{Lorentz force}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $u_i$ is the covariant particle four-velocity, $x^i$ is its position, $\gamma = \sqrt{1+h^{ij}u_{i}u_j}$ is the Lorentz factor of the particle, $h_{ij}$, $h^{ij}$, $\sqrt{h}$ as well as $\alpha$, and $\beta^i$ are the metric coefficients at particle position. $D^i$ and $B^i$ are the contravariant field components measured at particle position.


## Current deposition

Charged particles deposit currents, $\bm{J}^i$, that go into Maxwell's equations as source terms. In general $\bm{J}^i = \rho \bm{\beta}^i c$, where $\rho$ is the charge density measured in the lab frame. Coupled with the equations of motion and Maxwell's equations, this relation ensures exact charge conservation, i.e., $\nabla\cdot \bm{J}^\mu\equiv \bm{J}^\mu_{;\mu} = 0$, where $\bm{J}^\mu$ is the contravariant four-current with $J^0 = \rho c$. Substituting $\tilde{\rho}\equiv \sqrt{h}\rho$, and $\bm{\mathcal{J}}^i\equiv \sqrt{h}\bm{J}^i$, we can rewrite the charge conservation in a more concise form:

$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} + \partial_i \bm{\mathcal{J}}^i = 0
$$

Thus, depositing currents as $\bm{\mathcal{J}}^i$ and then converting to $\bm{J}^i=\bm{\mathcal{J}}^i/\sqrt{h}$ one can ensure that the exact charge conservation is maintained (see [charge-conservative current deposition](/how/pic#charge-conservative-current-deposition)).
