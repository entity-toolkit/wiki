In order to host both GR and non-GR equations in a single framework while still retaining the maximum level of generality, we employ the 3+1 formulation of Maxwell's equations (see, e.g., [Gourgoulhon, 2012](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-24525-1)).

In the most general 3+1 formulation the metric and its inverse in arbitrary coordinate system can be represented in the following form:

\begin{align*}
g_{\mu\nu}&=\begin{bmatrix}
-\alpha^2+\beta_k\beta^k & \beta_i \\ 
\beta_j & h_{ij}
\end{bmatrix},\\\\
g^{\mu\nu}&=\begin{bmatrix}
-1/\alpha^2 & \beta^i/\alpha^2 \\ 
\beta^j/\alpha^2 & h^{ij}-\beta^i\beta^j/\alpha^2
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}

where $\alpha$ is the metric _lapse function_, and $\beta_i$ is the metric _shift vector_. We will also denote $h \equiv \mathrm{det}{(h_{ij})}$. Notice also, that $g\equiv \mathrm{det}{(g_{\mu\nu})} = -\alpha^2 h$, and $\sqrt{-g}=\alpha\sqrt{h}$.

In this system, we can now express the curl of an arbitrary contravariant vector:

$$
(\nabla\times A)^i \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j A_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j h_{kp}A^p,
$$

where $A_k = h_{kp} A^p$, and $\varepsilon^{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.

## Maxwell's equations

In the general 3+1 formulation (special and general relativistic) there are two "physical" fields (the ones measured by fiducial observers, FIDOs), $B^i$, and $D^i$. Evolution equations on these two fields can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial D^i}{c\partial t} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j H_k - \frac{4\pi}{c} J^i, \\
\frac{\partial B^i}{c\partial t} &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j E_k,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $H_i$, and $E_i$ are the covariant auxiliary fields, defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H_i &= \alpha h_{ij} B^j - \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon_{ijk}\beta^j D^k, \\
E_i &= \alpha h_{ij} D^j + \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\varepsilon_{ijk}\beta^j B^k.
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! example "Flat space-time with diagonal metric"

    In flat space-time with diagonal metric, $\alpha=1$, and $\beta^i=0$, we have $D_i = E_i = h_{ij} E^j$, and $B_i = H_i = h_{ij} B^j$. Maxwell's equations then reduce to a closed form:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial E^i}{c\partial t} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j B_k - \frac{4\pi}{c} J^i, \\
    \frac{\partial B^i}{c\partial t} &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \varepsilon^{ijk}\partial_j E_k,
    \end{aligned}.
    $$

    If we further assume that the coordinate system is also flat, $h_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$, we get the more familiar form:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial E^i}{c\partial t} &= (\nabla\times \bm{B})^i - \frac{4\pi}{c} J^i, \\
    \frac{\partial B^i}{c\partial t} &= -(\nabla\times\bm{E})^i,
    \end{aligned}.
    $$

<!-- ### Axisymmetric

In 2D spherical coordinate system (axisymmetric, $\partial_\phi = 0$) discretized version of Maxwell's equation on $E^1$ ("radial") is singular at the polar axis: $h^{(i+1/2,~0)} = h^{(i+1/2,~n_2-1)} = 0$. -->

## Equations of motion for particles

The equation of motion for relativistic particles in such a 3+1 formulation have the following form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d x^i}{cd t} &= \alpha \frac{1}{\gamma}h^{ij} u_j - \beta^i,\\
\frac{d u_i}{cd t} &=
\underbrace{
  -\gamma \partial_i \alpha + u_j\partial_i \beta^j - \frac{\alpha}{2\gamma} u_j u_k\partial_i h^{jk}
}_{\text{``curvature'' force}} +
\underbrace{
  \frac{q}{m c^2}\alpha\left(h_{ij}D^j + \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}\gamma}\varepsilon_{ijk}h^{jl} u_l B^k\right)
}_{\text{Lorentz force}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $u_i$ are the three components of the particle's covariant four-velocity, $x^i$ is its position, $\gamma = \sqrt{\varepsilon+h^{ij}u_{i}u_j}$ is the energy of the particle ($\varepsilon\equiv 1$ for massive particles, and $\varepsilon\equiv 0$ for photons), $h_{ij}$, $h^{ij}$, $\sqrt{h}$ as well as $\alpha$, and $\beta^i$ are the metric coefficients at particle's position. $D^i$ and $B^i$ are the contravariant field components also measured at particle's position.
