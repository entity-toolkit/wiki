# Dependencies

To compile the code you need to have the following dependencies installed:

  - [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) (version >= 3.16; verify by running `cmake --version`).
  - [`GCC`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (version >= 8.3.1; verify by running `g++ --version`), [`llvm`](https://llvm.org/) (tested on version >= 11; verify by running `clang++ --version`) or [Intel C++ compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/dpc-compiler.html) (version >= 19.1 or higher; verify by running `icx --version`).
  - to compile for NVIDIA GPUs, you need to have the [`CUDA toolkit`](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed (version >= 11.0; verify by running `nvcc --version`).
  - to compile for AMD GPUs, you will need the [ROCm libraries and the HIP compilers/runtime](https://github.com/ROCm/HIP) (verify by running `hipcc --version`).
  - `MPI` (e.g., `OpenMPI`, `MPICH`, etc.; verify by running `mpicxx --version`) for multi-node simulations.
  - `HDF5` for data output (verify by running `h5c++ --version`).

!!! note "Cuda compatibility"

    Note, that different versions of `CUDA` are compatible with different host compiler versions (i.e., `gcc`, `llvm`, etc.). Please, refer to the [following curated list](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) for the compatibility matrix.

All the other third-party dependencies, such as `Kokkos` and `ADIOS2`, are included in the repository as submodules and can be automatically compiled when you run `cmake` (although, we recommend to install `ADIOS2` externally as it can take a while to compile). 

In addition to this section, we also provide more detailed instructions on how to set up the dependencies as well as the submit scripts for the most popular and widely used clusters [in the following section](../useful/cluster-setups.md).

!!! note

    To play with the code with all the dependencies already installed in the containerized environment, please refer to [the section on Docker](./8-docker.md).

---

## Preinstalling third-party libraries

To speed up the compilation process, it is often beneficial to precompile & install the third-party libraries and use those during the build process, either by setting the appropriate environment variables, using it within a conda/spack environment, or by using environment modules. Alternatively, of course, you can use the libraries provided by your system package manager (`pacman`, `apt`, `brew`, `nix`, ...), or the cluster's module system.

!!! warning

    If the system you're working on has `MPI` or `HDF5` already installed (either through environment modules or any package manager), it's highly recommended to use these libraries, instead of building your own. Instructions for these two here are provided as a last resort.

### Spack (recommended)

[Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is essentially a package manager for HPC systems which allows to install all the dependencies locally, optionally cross-compiling them with the already available libraries. If spack is not already available on your system (or on a cluster), you can simply download it (preferably to your home directory) with:

```sh
git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true --depth=2 https://github.com/spack/spack.git
```

and add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (or analogous) startup file:

```sh
. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

to activate `spack` on shell login.

#### Identifying pre-installed compilers/packages

Since spack compiles everything from the source code, it is recommended to use as many of the already pre-installed packages as possible. In particular, you can use the already installed compilers, or big libraries, such as the MPI and HDF5. To make spack aware of their existence, you can simply run:

```sh
# to add compilers
spack compiler add
# and to add all libraries
spack external find
```

!!! note

    If your machine is using environment modules, you may need to first load the compilers/libraries you need, before running the command above, e.g.:
    ```sh
    module load gcc/13
    module load openmpi/5
    ```

If for some reason spack does not find the local package you need, you may want to add it manually, by modifying the `$HOME/.spack/packages.yaml` file to add the following (example for locally installed `cuda` and `openmpi`):
```yaml
packages:
  # ...
  cuda:
    buildable: false
    externals:
    - prefix: /opt/cuda/
      spec: cuda@12.8
  openmpi:
    buildable: false
    externals:
    - prefix: /usr/
      spec: openmpi@5.0.6
```

Then you can run, e.g., `spack spec cuda` to check whether it finds the package: `[e]` at the front will indicate that it found the external package, if so -- you can "install" it in spack by using `spack install cuda` or `spack install openmpi`.

To check which packages `spack` has found, simply run `spack find` or to check the compilers, run `spack compilers`.

!!! note

    It is strongly recommended to use the pre-installed `MPI`, `CUDA` and other big libraries, instead of installing them via `spack` since these can be specifically configured on the machine you're running on.

#### Setting up spack environment

After that, it is recommended to create a spack environment and install all the other libraries within it. To do so, first create & activate the environment by running:

```sh
spack env create entity-env
spack env activate entity-env
```

Whenever you activate this environment, spack will automatically add the libraries installed within it to the `PATH` so that `cmake` can identify them when compiling the `Entity`. Within the environment you may now install all the necessary libraries. Below we present the possible commands you may need to run for each of them. Make sure to first check which dependencies will `spack` use to compile the library before actually installing. For that, you can run, e.g.,

```sh
spack spec kokkos <OPTIONS>
```

which will show all the dependencies it will use. In front of each dependency, you'll see one of the following:

* `[e]`: external (locally installed) package, 

* `[+]`: a package already installed within spack, 

* `[-]`: a package that will be downloaded and built during the installation.

Once you're satisfied, you may run `spack install --add kokkos <OPTIONS>` to actually perform the installation (within the environment).

=== "`HDF5`"
    It is highly recommended to use the `HDF5` already installed on the cluster and find it via `spack` as described above. Nonetheless, you may also install it via `spack` using the following command:
    ```sh
    spack install --add hdf5 +cxx
    ```
    You may also add `-mpi` flag to disable the `MPI` support.

=== "`ADIOS2`"
    Because we rely on `HDF5` together with the `ADIOS2`, it is recommended to have `hdf5` installed externally (and make sure `spack` sees that installation by running `spack spec hdf5`). You can then install `ADIOS2` (in a `spack` environment) using the following command:
    ```sh
    spack install --add adios2 +hdf5 +pic
    ```
    You may also add `-mpi` option to disable the `MPI` support (`HDF5` will also have to be serial for that to work).

=== "`Kokkos`"
    For `Kokkos`, you will always use the following settings `+pic +aggressive_vectorization` on top of the architecture specific settings. For example, to compile with `CUDA` support on Ampere80 architecture (A100 card), you can do
    ```sh
    spack install --add kokkos +pic +aggressive_vectorization +cuda +wrapper cuda_arch=80
    ```

    And, again, before running this command, make sure to run it with `spack spec ...` instead of `spack install --add` with the same options just to make sure spack will not install an external CUDA.

!!! note

    Sometimes `spack` might not recognize the CPU architecture properly, especially when compiling on a node different from the one where the code will be running (e.g., login node vs compute node). In that case, when compiling the `kokkos`, you may need to provide also the following option: `target=zen2` (or other target cpu architecture). This might fail on the first try, since by default `spack` does not allow for manual architecture specification, in which case first reconfigure spack using `spack config add concretizer:targets:host_compatible:false`, and then try again.

!!! tip  "`spack info`"

    To see all the available configuration options for a given package, simply run `spack info <PACKAGE>`.

!!! tip "Using an explicit compiler"

    You can instruct `spack` to use a specific compiler which it has identified (find out by running `spack compilers`) by adding the following flag (example for `clang`):
    ```sh
    spack install <PACKAGE> <OPTIONS> %clang
    ```

!!! tip "Garbage collection"
    
    Simply uninstalling the package may left behind some build caches which often take up a lot of space. To get rid of these, you may run `spack gc` which will try its best to delete all these caches as well as all the unused packages.

---

### Anaconda

If you want to have `ADIOS2` with the serial `HDF5` support (i.e., without `MPI`) installed in the conda environment, we provide a shell script `conda-entity-nompi.sh` which installs the proper compiler, the `hdf5` library, and the `ADIOS2`. Run the scripts via:

```shell
source conda-entity-nompi.sh
```

This also `pip`-installs the `nt2.py` package for post-processing. With this configuration, the `Kokkos` library will be built in-tree.

---

### Building dependencies from source

The form below allows you to generate the appropriate build scripts and optionally the environment modules for the libraries you want to compile and install.

    3. Copy three `.cmake` scripts from the uncompressed HDF5 directory to the temporary directory:
    ```sh
    cp hdf5-1.14.6/config/cmake/scripts/*.cmake .
    ```

    4. In `HDF5options.cmake` uncomment the following line:
    ```cmake
    set (ADD_BUILD_OPTIONS "${ADD_BUILD_OPTIONS} -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF")
    ```
