# Input parameters

Entity reads almost all the information (except for the problem generator) about the simulation at runtime from an input file provided in the `.toml` format. The most up-to-date full version of the input file with all the possible input parameters with their descriptions can be found in the root directory of the main repository in the `input.example.toml`.
